<h2>Analysis of the Show – Shark Tank India</h2>

________________________________________
**Overview / Objective:**

This project focuses on analysing the popular Indian television show Shark Tank India, which has become a prominent platform for entrepreneurs seeking investments from seasoned business investors, known as "Sharks." The primary objective of this analysis is to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights from the data collected across multiple seasons of the show. These insights can help aspiring entrepreneurs make informed decisions about whether to pitch their business on the show.

**Problem Statement:**

Upon examining the dataset, I approached the analysis from the perspective of a potential entrepreneur. I asked myself:
“Should I pitch my startup on Shark Tank India? Is it worth it in terms of visibility and the likelihood of securing an investment?”
This question formed the core problem statement for the project. By exploring the data, I aimed to answer this key question and help other entrepreneurs understand the potential value of appearing on the show.
